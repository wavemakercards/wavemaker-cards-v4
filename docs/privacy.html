    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>Our website addresses are: 
        <ul>
            <li>https://wavemaker.co.uk</li>
            <li>https://wavemakercards.com</li>
               <li>https://wavemaker.cards</li>
        </ul></p>
    <h2>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
    <p>I&#8217;m going to keep this simple and basic.</p>
    <p><strong>The most recent Wavemaker App does not store any of your novel information on our servers &#8211; it&#8217;s all under your control. Whether it&#8217;s stored locally using  or in your personal Google Drive account.</strong></p>
    <p>The same applies for Version 2 of the app, but it required a google login<br />
    I only store user details for login purposes &#8211; It usually consists of your google ID (or Facebook ID and email address if you have provided one in version 1).</p>
    <p>The Version1<strong> CARDS app </strong>which I am planning on closing down in the near future does store your novel information. However you can download that and export it. I will be deleting the app soon but will send an email to active users with a warning in advance. This will delete all copies of that data&#8230;.. forever.</p>
    <h4>Information we hold on you (only applies to the VERSION 2 Web App )</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Your Google ID</li>
    <li>Your Google Email</li>
    <li>Your Name</li>
    <li>Your Last login date to the app</li>
    <li>The Date you first used the app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please Note : the current app stores NO data online and the rights and ownership of anything you create using our app is YOURS.</p>
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
    <p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>
    <h3>Media</h3>

    <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>

    <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>

    <h2>Who we share your data with</h2>
    <h2>How long we retain your data</h2>

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
